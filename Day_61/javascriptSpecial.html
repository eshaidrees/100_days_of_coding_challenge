               //   JavaScript specials
               // This chapter briefly recaps the features of JavaScript that we’ve learned by now, paying special attention to subtle moments.

               // Code structure

               // Statements are delimited with a semicolon:
               alert('Hello'); alert('World');

              // Usually, a line-break is also treated as a delimiter, so that would also work:
              alert('Hello')
              alert('World')

             // That’s called “automatic semicolon insertion”. Sometimes it doesn’t work, for instance:
              alert("There will be an error after this message")
              [2,3].forEach(alert) 
            // Most codestyle guides agree that we should put a semicolon after each statement.
            // Semicolons are not required after code blocks {...} and syntax constructs with them like loops:
            function f() {
                 // no semicolon needed after function declaration
            }
            for(;;) {
                // no semicolon needed after loop
            }
            //…But even if we can put an “extra” semicolon somewhere, that’s not an error. It will be ignored.

           // Variables......
           //Can be declared using:

             //let
             //const (constant, can’t be changed)
             //var (old-style, will see later)
             // A variable name can include:

            // Letters and digits, but the first character may not be a digit.
            // Characters $ and _ are normal, on par with letters.
            // Non-Latin alphabets and hieroglyphs are also allowed, but commonly not used.
            // Variables are dynamically typed. They can store any value:

           let x = 5;
           x = "John";
           // There are 8 data types:

           //1 number for both floating-point and integer numbers,
           //2 bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length,
           //3 string for strings,
           //4 boolean for logical values: true/false,
           //5 null – a type with a single value null, meaning “empty” or “does not exist”,
           //6 undefined – a type with a single value undefined, meaning “not assigned”,
           //7 object and symbol – for complex data structures and unique identifiers, we haven’t learnt them yet.

         // The typeof operator returns the type for a value, with two exceptions:
           
         typeof null == "object" // error in the language
         typeof function(){} == "function" // functions are treated specially

         
            // Interaction............
            
            // We’re using a browser as a working environment, so basic UI functions will be:

            // prompt(question, [default])
            // Ask a question, and return either what the visitor entered or null if they clicked “cancel”.

            // confirm(question)
            // Ask a question and suggest to choose between Ok and Cancel. The choice is returned as true/false.

            // alert(message)
            // Output a message.

            // All these functions are modal, they pause the code execution and prevent the visitor from
            // interacting with the page until they answer.

            let userName = prompt("Your name?", "Alice");
            let isTeaWanted = confirm("Do you want some tea?");

            alert("Visitor:" + userName);
            alert("Tea wanted:" + isTeaWanted)

            
            // Operators...........

            // JavaScript supports the following operators:

            // Arithmetical
            // Regular: * + - /, also % for the remainder and ** for power of a number.

            // The binary plus + concatenates strings. And if any of the operands is a string, the
            // other one is converted to string too:
            alert('1' + 2);  // '12', string
            alert(1 + '2');  // '12', string
            alert(2 + 3 + '5');  // '55', string

            // Assignments
            // There is a simple assignment: a = b and combined ones like a *= 2.
            
            // Logical operators
            // Logical AND && and OR || perform short-circuit evaluation and then return the value
            // where it stopped (not necessary true/false). Logical NOT ! converts the operand to
            // boolean type and returns the inverse value.

            // Nullish coalescing operator
            // The ?? operator provides a way to choose a defined value from a list of variables. The
            // result of a ?? b is a unless it’s null/undefined, then b.

            // Comparisons
            // Equality check == for values of different types converts them to a number (except null
            // and undefined that equal each other and nothing else), so these are equal:
            alert(0 == false);  // true
            alert(0 == '');     // true

            
            // Other comparisons convert to a number as well.

            // The strict equality operator === doesn’t do the conversion: different types always mean
            // different values for it.

            // Values null and undefined are special: they equal == each other and don’t equal anything else.

            // Greater/less comparisons compare strings character-by-character, other types are converted
            // to a number.

            // Other operators
            // There are few others, like a comma operator.

            // Loops............
            // We covered 3 types of loops:
            /*
            // 1
            while (condition) {
            ...
            }

            // 2
            do {
            ...
            } while (condition);

            // 3
            for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            ...
            }
            */
            
            // The variable declared in for(let...) loop is visible only inside the loop. But we can also
            // omit let and reuse an existing variable.

            // Directives break/continue allow to exit the whole loop/current iteration. Use labels to
            // break nested loops.

            // The “switch” construct..........

            // The “switch” construct can replace multiple if checks. It uses === (strict equality) for
            // comparisons.
            let age = prompt('Your age?', 18);

            switch (age) {
                case 18:
                    alert("Won't Work");  // the result of prompt is a string, not a number
                    break;
                case "18":
                    alert("This Work");
                    break;
                default: 
                    alert("Any value not equal to one above");
            }

            // Functions...............
            // We covered three ways to create a function in JavaScript:

            // 1. Function Declaration: the function in the main code flow
            function sum(a, b) {
                let result = a + b;
                return result; 
            }
            alert(sum(1, 2));

            // 2. Function Expression: the function in the context of an expression
            let sum = function(a, b) {
                let result = a + b;
                return result;
            }
            alert(sum(4,5));

            // 3. Arrow Functions:

            // expression on the right side:
            let sum = (a, b) => a + b;

            // or multi-line syntax with {...}, need return here:
            let sum = (a, b) => {
                // ...
                return a + b;
            }

            // without arguments
            let sum = () => alert("Hello");

            // with a single argument
            let double = n => n*2;
